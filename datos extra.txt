You can use to() and except() to send the packet to specific clients:

// the “hello” event will be broadcast to all connected clients that are either
// in the "room1" room or in the "room2" room, excluding those in the "room3" room

io.to("room1").to("room2").except("room3").emit("hello");
--------------
Sets a modifier for a subsequent event emission that the event will only be broadcast to clients that have not joined the given rooms.

// the "foo" event will be broadcast to all connected clients, except the ones that are in the "room-101" room
io.except("room-101").emit("foo", "bar");

// with an array of rooms
io.except(["room-101", "room-102"]).emit("foo", "bar");

// with multiple chained calls
io.except("room-101").except("room-102").emit("foo", "bar");
